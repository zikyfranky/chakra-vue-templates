To fetch the current github stargazers count during development it is necessary to create a `.env.development.local` file with a [GitHub

Make sure the token permissions look like this

In other words âœ… in the **repo** checkbox and then click on **Generate Token**

```txt
GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

## Development

## Adding a new Template

Adding a new template can be archived within 2 simple steps.

1. Update the data in `src/data/index.ts`

   > This is the main data source of the website. Find the right category or create a new one if necessary.

1. Create the template file itself in `src/pages/templates`
   > Attention! The file structure must match the data inside `src/data/index.ts`

### Miscellaneous

- All templates are build mobile first. So keep this in mind for your template.
- Use the object syntax for responsive props. Learn more about this here: [https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/responsive-styles#the-object-syntax](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/responsive-styles#the-object-syntax)
